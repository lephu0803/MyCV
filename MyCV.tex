I am a studious person who is eager to learn new things and ready to face of challenges.  I would like get in-depth and comprehensively understand the data instead of giving a try or depending on the state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms and fine-tuning the model without looking back the data. I want to improve understanding of fundamental mathematical behind machine learning algorithms, understanding the data for telling story behind them. Therefore, I am seeking for a Data Scientist position to strengthen my working skills in Data Science. Also, I would like to contribute my abilities to the company and my working team. Beside of that, nearly, I have became a part-time stock trader so it would be great if I have a chance to join a finance company.
